# How I started

I kind *of* remember how I started.
Before trying to write code, I was your average minecraft player.
I also later decided to play Roblox
(and acted like it was a kids game,
*little did I know, it was more than that*,
and that would be my future).
I first wanted to learn C++,
I watched a tutorial on it (and didn't do anything alongside),
and I failed, as expected, you don't get everything first try.
I gave up for a while.

## When did I start doing X?

Scripting:
kinda hard to remember,
but I can get a solid answer by looking at a folder that I still have on my computer to this day!
My folder in "Documents/Roblox Scripts",
I created it on Wednesday, August 24, 2022, 5:17:17 PM.
Here's the image if you want it:

Exploiting (on Roblox):
also hard to remember.
Hacking (on Minecraft):
I can get a solid answer by looking at my folder that I still have on my computer to this day,
my folder on the desktop called "Packet V2" (because I was using Packet V2 at the time). I created it on Tuesday, July 12, 2022, at 1:56:05 PM
